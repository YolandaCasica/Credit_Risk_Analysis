# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Applying machine learning algorithms to determine a person's credit card risk.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a machine learning models that could be used to predict credit risk. Machine learning uses statistical algorithms to learn from data patterns and make predictions. There are different ways to build a machine learning, but for this project a supervised machine learning model was built. Supervised machine learning is able to handle labeled data, which was useful since categorical data needed to be trained and tested. The following analysis will describe the process taken to create our prediction model.
